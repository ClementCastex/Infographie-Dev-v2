                On this graph, we can observe that the majority of companies operate in the service or commerce sectors.
                This suggests that a significant portion of businesses need to expand, whether it's through community
                engagement on social networks, marketing advice, visual enhancements, or updating their websites. All of
                these aspects fall within the skill set of students at this school.

                On this graph, we can see that the number of apprentices has stabilized at a good level today. While
                this may reassure some individuals, others may focus more on the decline in 2021, which could be
                explained by the Covid-19 health situation. This period was beneficial initially for apprentices but not
                towards the end.

                Now that we've seen where students do their apprenticeships and the number who go each year, we may
                notice that the majority of companies are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), accounting for 74%.
                This means that a large portion of companies hiring apprentices are in a good position to do so.

                After reassuring students about the stability of the number of apprentices, it's noteworthy that most
                companies are located in Rouen and its Metropolitan area, with a limited presence of apprentices outside
                the 76 and 27 departments of Normandy. This might reassure some students who haven't obtained their
                driver's license.

            While this graph clearly shows that the majority of companies are less than ten years old, confirming that most
            are young and therefore SMEs, as seen previously.
